    "### What is machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning is the science (and art) of programming so computers can learn from data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to leran without being explicitle programmed\n",
    "\n",
    "- A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T , as measured by P improves with experience E.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning is a technique to be used when traditional programming techniques are not enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example if you want to detect spam filters with traditional programming techniques, you have to write rules for ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In contrast if you use a machine learning algorithm you just need to provide the computer with the user tagged spam filters, and computer will find the patterns between this inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also with machine learning models you can automate the process of "
